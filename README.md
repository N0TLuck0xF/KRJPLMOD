KRJPLMod - A One-Man Mission to Revolutionize Programming

About Me

Hi, I'm the sole developer, founder, and owner of KRJPLMod. This is a one-man project, built from the ground up with a vision to create a high-performance, secure, and future-proof programming language. I am the only developer, planner, and organizer, and I am committed to working on KRJPLMod for the next 15 years, keeping the evolution of technology in mind.

My Current Situation

As of right now, I live in a shed without a bathroom. I am pushing through extreme financial hardship to make this dream a reality. It takes a lot to say this, but I need all the support I can get to keep working on KRJPLMod.

The Future of KRJPLMod

Improve its performance and security.

Expand documentation and learning resources.

Build a strong community around KRJPLMod.

Ensure KRJPLMod remains at the cutting edge of technology for the next 15 years.

Thank you to anyone who supports this mission. Even just spreading the word means the world to me.
