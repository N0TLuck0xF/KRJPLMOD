# AI Integration in KRJPLMod

## Introduction
KRJPLMod provides seamless integration with AI technologies, enabling developers to create smart applications, automate tasks, and integrate machine learning models with ease. This guide covers how to use AI capabilities within KRJPLMod.

## 1. Setting Up AI in Your Project
To begin using AI features, initialize a new AI-powered project:
```bash
krjplmod new ai_project --ai
cd ai_project
```
This sets up the necessary files and dependencies for AI development.

## 2. Loading AI Models
KRJPLMod supports loading and running AI models directly:
```krjplmod
let model = ai.load_model("model.onnx");
```
This loads a pre-trained ONNX model for inference.

## 3. Using AI for Text Generation
Generate text using an AI language model:
```krjplmod
let response = ai.generate_text("Write a story about space exploration.");
web.p(response);
```
This leverages an AI model to generate content dynamically.

## 4. Image Recognition and Computer Vision
KRJPLMod enables image classification and object detection:
```krjplmod
let image = ai.load_image("photo.jpg");
let result = ai.detect_objects(image);
web.p("Detected: " + result);
```
This loads an image and detects objects within it.

## 5. Speech Recognition
Convert speech to text using built-in AI tools:
```krjplmod
let text = ai.speech_to_text("audio.wav");
web.p("Transcribed: " + text);
```

## 6. AI Chatbots and Assistants
Create an AI chatbot using predefined models:
```krjplmod
let chatbot = ai.create_chatbot("Assistant");
let reply = chatbot.respond("How do I use KRJPLMod?");
web.p(reply);
```
This allows users to interact with an intelligent assistant.

## 7. Automating Workflows with AI
KRJPLMod can automate tasks using AI-driven logic:
```krjplmod
ai.automate(fn() {
    let emails = ai.read_emails();
    if emails.contains("urgent") {
        ai.auto_reply("I'll respond shortly.");
    }
});
```
This example scans emails and automatically responds to urgent ones.

## 8. AI-Powered Game Development
Enhance games with AI-powered NPCs:
```krjplmod
npc.brain = ai.create_ai("enemy_behavior");
npc.brain.train(["patrol", "chase", "attack"]);
```
This trains an AI-driven enemy in a KRJPLMod game.
