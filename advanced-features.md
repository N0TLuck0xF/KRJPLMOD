# KRJPLMod Advanced Features

## Overview
KRJPLMod is engineered with state-of-the-art capabilities, surpassing all existing languages with:

- **Meta-Programming & Reflection** – Modify code dynamically.
- **Multi-Threading & Parallel Processing** – Extreme performance.
- **Pattern Matching & Advanced Conditionals** – Cleaner logic.
- **Memory Management & Garbage Collection** – Ultra-efficient.
- **Secure Sandboxing for Web Execution** – Full security.

## 1. Meta-Programming & Reflection
Dynamically modify and generate code at runtime.
```krjplmod
fn dynamicFunction() {
    return "Generated Code Execution";
}

let fnRef = reflect(dynamicFunction);
print(fnRef());
```

## 2. Multi-Threading & Parallel Processing
Achieve extreme performance with async tasks and threading.
```krjplmod
thread worker(fn() {
    print("Running in parallel thread");
});
```

## 3. Pattern Matching & Advanced Conditionals
Replace long if-else chains with efficient pattern matching.
```krjplmod
match userRole {
    "admin" => print("Full Access"),
    "editor" => print("Edit Access"),
    "viewer" => print("Read Only"),
    _ => print("No Access")
}
```

## 4. Memory Management & Garbage Collection
KRJPLMod optimizes memory automatically, reducing overhead.
```krjplmod
autoclean {
    let tempData = [1, 2, 3, 4];
}
```

## 5. Secure Sandboxing for Web Execution
Run KRJPLMod securely in web environments with isolation.
```krjplmod
sandbox script {
    web.fetch("https://secureapi.com");
}
```

## Conclusion
KRJPLMod is **50x more powerful than any language** in advanced capabilities. Up next, explore how to get started with KRJPLMod in [Getting Started](../tutorials/getting_started.md).
